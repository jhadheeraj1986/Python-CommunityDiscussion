# Python-CommunityDiscussion


This repository contains code/documents explained in Python community discussion organized on each Tuesday and Thursday.

We are building a strong community for Python at "Python-Community Discussion" forum. We are Python developers from all experience level and believe in collaborating and learning together.

We do a community session on each Tuesday and Thursday at 9:00 PM IST. Here one of our speakers gives detail information on any Python topic.

As this is just a start, we are encouraging people to speak up on any Python basic or advance topics. We also welcome those who want to present their work.
Currently, we are going through the Python basics. So it's beneficial if you want to learn Python or refresh your basics.

It is a place to show up your skills as there is no judge. If you have any issue, you can discuss in the forum. You can collaborate with others for any project you want to work.

I welcome everyone to join our community.
